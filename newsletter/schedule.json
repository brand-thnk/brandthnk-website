It's <em>anticipating desire</em>, even when customers can't articulate it yet. That's what separates brands that grow markets from those that just compete within them, and few stories capture this better than the <strong>Aeron chair</strong>, a product that redefined not just office comfort but what innovation actually looks like in practice.</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p>Before 1994, the office chair was a background object. It was functional, forgettable, and uninspired. Companies bought them in bulk, employees tolerated them, and nobody thought twice about whether sitting at work could be anything other than a necessary discomfort. The executive leather throne existed as a status symbol, not a functional improvement. The ergonomic chair, as we now understand it, simply didn't exist in the cultural imagination. Chairs were things you sat in, not things that worked with your body.</p>\n\n<p>Then Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf came along with an idea that nobody had asked for. Working with Herman Miller, they set out not to build a better chair but to <strong>rethink the entire experience of sitting at work</strong>. As Stumpf put it, \"We looked at what the chair had to do, not what it's supposed to look like.\" This distinction sounds subtle, but it's actually radical. Most product development starts with form, with aesthetics, with what the market expects to see. Chadwick and Stumpf started with function, with the human body, with the reality of what eight hours of sitting actually does to a person.</p>\n\n<p>What they created looked like nothing the market had seen. They introduced <strong>Pellicle mesh</strong>, a radical alternative to traditional padding that allowed air to flow and heat to dissipate. They developed <strong>PostureFit</strong> spine support that worked with the body's natural curves rather than forcing it into an unnatural position. The silhouette was industrial, almost skeletal, bearing no resemblance to the plush leather executive thrones that signaled success in corporate America. It was bold, unconventional, and at first, it failed spectacularly.</p>\n\n<p>Critics called the Aeron ugly. Customers were confused by what they were looking at and uncertain why anyone would pay premium prices for something that looked like office furniture from a science fiction movie. The market wasn't asking for this kind of chair because the market didn't know this kind of chair was possible. This is exactly the point that gets lost in most discussions of innovation. We talk about listening to customers and responding to market demand, but the most transformative products often emerge from a willingness to ignore what customers say they want in favor of delivering what they actually need.</p>\n\n<p>The Aeron's journey from rejected oddity to design icon happened gradually and then all at once. People started sitting in it, and something clicked. The mesh that looked strange turned out to breathe in ways fabric and leather couldn't. The ergonomic support that seemed excessive turned out to eliminate the back pain that office workers had simply accepted as inevitable. Word spread through the channels that matter most: person to person, body to body, one converted skeptic telling another that this weird-looking chair had changed how they felt at the end of a workday.</p>\n\n<p>Silicon Valley adopted the Aeron early, which makes sense when you think about it. The tech industry was full of people who spent twelve-hour days in front of computers and who valued function over tradition. The Aeron became a status symbol of a different kind, not the leather throne of the corner office but the tool of the knowledge worker who cared more about performance than appearance. It signaled a certain kind of thinking, a willingness to embrace the unconventional if the unconventional actually worked better.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, the Aeron landed in the <strong>Museum of Modern Art's</strong> permanent collection, the ultimate validation for a product that had once been dismissed as ugly. What began as a rejected idea had become a movement, proof that <strong>the best innovations often start as misunderstandings</strong>. The market that didn't ask for the Aeron came to define itself by it.</p>\n\n<p>There's a deeper lesson here for anyone building products or brands. The most powerful ideas rarely come from what customers say they want. Customers can tell you about their frustrations with existing solutions, but they can't imagine solutions that don't yet exist. They can describe the pain of a bad office chair, but they can't envision Pellicle mesh. They know they're uncomfortable, but they don't know what comfort could look like. This is why focus groups and surveys, while useful, can never be the whole story. They capture articulated needs, which represent only a fraction of human desire.</p>\n\n<p>The real opportunity lies in <em>unarticulated needs</em>, the desires that people don't even know they have because they've never seen them satisfied. Chadwick and Stumpf understood this intuitively. They didn't ask people what they wanted in a chair because they knew the answers would be incremental: more padding, softer leather, better lumbar support. Instead, they watched how people actually sat, studied what prolonged sitting did to the human body, and designed a solution for problems that most people had stopped noticing because they'd accepted them as unchangeable.</p>\n\n<p>This is how you train yourself to <strong>think like a brand builder</strong> rather than a product optimizer. The product optimizer takes customer feedback and makes things marginally better. The brand builder imagines possibilities that customers can't articulate and has the courage to pursue them even when the initial response is confusion or rejection.</p>\n\n<p>Try this exercise with your team in your next meeting. Pick an everyday object in your workspace, something mundane like a stapler, a pen, or a pair of headphones. List every pain point that comes with using it, both functional and emotional. Don't stop at the obvious frustrations; dig into the small irritations that people have stopped complaining about because they seem inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Now go deeper. What <em>unarticulated needs</em> might exist around this object? What would transform the experience rather than just fixing the flaws? What would make someone say \"I didn't know I needed this until I had it\"? Redesign the object by focusing on what it <em>could do</em> rather than what it <em>should look like</em>. The goal isn't to create a prototype or even a viable product concept. The goal is to strengthen your team's innovation muscle, to practice the kind of thinking that led to the Aeron.</p>\n\n<p>Share what you come up with and discuss it openly. You'll likely find that the most interesting ideas feel uncomfortable at first because they challenge assumptions about what the object is supposed to be. That discomfort is a signal, not a warning. It means you're thinking past the obvious, past the incremental, into the territory where real innovation lives.</p>\n\n<p>The Aeron chair teaches us that <strong>the most powerful ideas come from the courage to imagine what customers will thank you for later</strong>, even when they can't ask for it now. It's easier to give people what they say they want. It's harder, and ultimately more valuable, to give them what they didn't know they were missing. The brands that grow markets rather than just competing within them are the ones willing to sit with that discomfort, to endure the initial rejection, and to trust that understanding runs deeper than articulation.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

The gesture gets processed out of the process.</p>\n\n<p>But gratitude at scale isn't an oxymoron. It's just hard, and the brands that pull it off don't choose between systematic and authentic. They design for both.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chewy has become famous for moments that feel anything but scaled.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When a customer's pet passes away, they send flowers. When someone's been a loyal customer, they send a handwritten note with a team member's name on it - an actual person who took time to write something real.</p>\n\n<p>But Chewy isn't small, so how do they make gratitude feel personal at that volume?</p>\n\n<p>First, they built infrastructure for it by giving their customer service team the authority and budget to send gifts without approval loops. And, they trained people to notice moments that matter. They made thoughtfulness part of the job description vs. an exception to policy.</p>\n\n<p>The result is that customers don't just stay loyal. They post about it, tell stories, and become advocates because the gesture felt like it came from a person instead of a marketing automation tool.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The system enabled the gesture - it didn't replace the humanity behind it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I saw something similar work at a fintech that wanted to recognize employees who went above and beyond. They didn't want it to feel top-down or robotic, so they built a peer nomination system where anyone could nominate anyone. Winners got a custom item, a handwritten note from leadership, and a Slack shoutout.</p>\n\n<p>The swag wasn't expensive, but people displayed them like trophies, and new hires asked how to earn one. It became a signal that said: this is what living our values looks like.</p>\n\n<p>What made it work wasn't the item itself but the story attached to it. The nomination came from a peer who noticed something worth calling out, and the note came from a leader who actually read the nomination. The object became proof of something that happened intead of another piece of company swag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gratitude isn't a tactic. It's a posture.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you operationalize it, you're not automating emotion. You're removing the friction that keeps people from acting on it.</p>\n\n<p>One company I worked with created a quarterly gratitude calendar and paired it with a gifting platform that let team members send small tokens on demand. They could send a book, a coffee gift card, or a local treat without needing approval. The only requirement was noticing a moment worth acknowledging.</p>\n\n<p>The budget was modest, but the impact wasn't. People finally had permission and infrastructure to do what they'd been wanting to do all along: say thank you in a way that mattered.</p>\n\n<p>Research backs this up. Sixty-eight percent of consumers say receiving a thank-you from a brand makes them more likely to purchase again, and forty-three percent say it makes them more likely to tell a friend. Gratitude works when it feels real, and it only feels real when you've designed systems that support human moments rather than replace them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question isn't whether to systematize gratitude. It's how to systematize it without sterilizing it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The companies that get this right share a few things in common. They give people permission to act without asking, and they create budgets that are small enough to use freely but meaningful enough to matter. They train for noticing rather than just executing, and they measure participation rather than just spend.</p>\n\n<p>Think about the last time your company showed gratitude to a customer, partner, or employee. Was it part of a system, or was it a one-off because someone went out of their way?</p>\n\n<p>If it's the latter, ask yourself what's stopping you from making that the norm. What infrastructure would need to exist for thoughtfulness to happen more often? What approval loops are getting in the way? What would it take to give your team the authority to act on the moments they already notice?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The best gratitude systems don't feel like systems at all.</strong></p>\n\n<p>They feel like a culture where saying thank you is easy, expected, and resourced. The calendar, the budget, and the owners are all there, but they fade into the background. What people remember is the gesture, and what they feel is the intention.</p>\n\n<p>That's the goal: not gratitude at scale, but gratitude that scales.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

Physical presence, handshakes, and local knowledge all mattered because the branch <em>was</em> the bank. If you weren't on Main Street, you weren't in the consideration set.</p>\n\n<p>Then it was digital. Mobile apps, online banking, and real-time everything took over. We spent a decade moving digital to the center, and budgets followed while org charts shifted. \"Digital transformation\" became the mantra that justified everything.</p>\n\n<p>But when everyone has an app, APIs, and instant payments, digital can't be a moat. AI is accelerating this commoditization even faster. Your mobile experience is one vendor switch away from being identical to your competitor's, and the features you spent three years building are now available off the shelf.</p>\n\n<p>So what's left? Brand.</p>\n\n<p>Not brand as logo or brand as tagline. <strong>Brand as the operating center of the bank.</strong> How customers and members actually experience you. The meaning you create. The trust you earn. The reason someone chooses you when the rates are the same.</p>\n\n<p>Brand is the only defensible differentiation left. But declaring it isn't enough.</p>\n\n<p>A community banker in Georgia put it to me plainly last month:</p>\n\n<p>Then he said something that stayed with me: <em>\"I have real concerns about the survival of community banks if we keep doing what we're doing.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Good numbers are the most dangerous force in banking right now.</strong> They create the illusion that the center is holding when it's actually drifting.</p>\n\n<p>This is a truth-telling problem. One of our core principles at BrandThnk is \"score what's true, not what you hope is true.\" Good financials make it easy to score what you hope is true. Revenue is up, deposits are growing, and the board is happy. Everything must be working.</p>\n\n<p>But the evidence is lagging. By the time the numbers catch up to the drift, you've lost ground you can't recover.</p>\n\n<p>Danny Meyer, the restaurateur, has a famous line that captures this perfectly: <em>\"Your staff and your guests are always moving your saltshaker off center. That's their job. It is the job of life. It's the law of entropy! Your job is just to move the shaker back each time and let them know exactly what you stand for.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Every day, forces are moving your brand off center. Market pressures and pricing wars. Quarterly targets overriding long-term positioning. Digital teams shipping off-brand experiences. Sales chasing any deal that walks in. Tech vendors promising transformation through features. And perhaps most insidious of all: complacency disguised as good financials.</p>\n\n<p>That's their job, and that's entropy. Leadership's job isn't to be frustrated by it. <strong>The job is to keep moving the saltshaker back.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The drift doesn't happen in one place - it happens across every layer of your organization.</p>\n\n<p>Think of your bank in three layers. At the <strong>Frontline</strong>, you have direct customer interactions through branches, call centers, and relationship managers. When the saltshaker drifts here, conversations become transactional. The human moments that create loyalty get squeezed out by efficiency metrics, and your people stop knowing customers and start processing them.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>Midline</strong>, you have experience orchestration through marketing, product, and CX. These are the teams that design how customers move through your ecosystem. When the saltshaker drifts here, you get fragmented journeys. Campaigns don't connect to product experiences, and onboarding doesn't reflect the promise you made in acquisition. Each team optimizes their slice while the whole becomes incoherent.</p>\n\n<p>At the <strong>Backline</strong>, you have operations and enablement through technology, compliance, and operations teams. When the saltshaker drifts here, you optimize for internal efficiency instead of customer meaning. The systems become the constraint, and \"we can't do that because of our core\" becomes the answer to every brand-forward idea.</p>\n\n<p>The drift is rarely dramatic - it's incremental. A small compromise in the Frontline, a campaign shortcut in the Midline, and a capability limitation in the Backline. Each one feels reasonable in isolation, but together they move the saltshaker so far off center that customers can't recognize what you stand for.</p>\n\n<p>There's another dynamic that accelerates the drift. We call it <strong>\"Busy does not equal Bold.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most FIs are extraordinarily busy. They have initiatives everywhere, projects in flight, teams running hard, and activity metrics through the roof. But activity is not the same as impact. Running fast toward the wrong center is worse than standing still, and when every team is optimizing their own metric, you get motion without direction.</p>\n\n<p>The banker in Georgia wasn't describing a lazy organization. He was describing one that was highly active and still drifting. The busyness was actually masking the problem because \"we're doing so much\" becomes a substitute for \"we're doing the right things.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bold means making choices that cost something.</strong> Saying no to a deal that doesn't fit. Killing a campaign that's off-brand even if it's performing. Slowing down a product launch until the experience is right. Bold is rare because it requires sacrificing activity for alignment.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you move the saltshaker back?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Start with the declaration.</strong> Brand is the center. Not branch, not digital. Brand. This isn't a marketing statement. It's an operating decision that means brand thinking shows up in product decisions, experience design, pricing strategy, and hiring. Not just campaigns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Build the discipline.</strong> The saltshaker will move every single day, and your job is to notice and correct. You need to demonstrate what \"brand as center\" looks like in real decisions, resource allocation, and customer moments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Apply the test.</strong> If you're willing to let others decide where center is, hand them the keys. When the pricing war starts and someone says \"we have to match,\" that's a saltshaker moment. When the vendor promises \"personalization at scale\" and you're about to buy features instead of building meaning, that's a saltshaker moment. When good numbers let you skip the hard conversation about what you actually stand for? That's the most dangerous saltshaker moment of all.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a practical exercise you can run in your next leadership meeting. I call it a Saltshaker Audit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name your center.</strong> In one sentence, what does your brand actually stand for? Not what you say, but what you do consistently. Apply what we call the One-Breath Test: if you can't say it in one breath, it's not clear enough. If you get five different answers from five leaders, your saltshaker has already drifted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>List the forces.</strong> What's actively pulling your brand off center right now? Be specific and name the initiative, the pressure, or the decision that's about to compromise what you stand for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Identify the drift.</strong> Where has the saltshaker already moved? What are you tolerating that you wouldn't have three years ago? What \"temporary\" compromises became permanent?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commit to one recenter.</strong> Pick one thing you'll move back this quarter. Not a campaign, but a decision. A \"no\" you've been avoiding. A standard you'll enforce.</p>\n\n<p>The goal isn't perfection - it's awareness and discipline.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing from that Georgia conversation. The banker said something that reframed how I think about the digital-human divide:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personalization is what technology does.</strong> It's algorithmic, data-driven, and automated. Your app can remember preferences, surface relevant offers, and anticipate behavior.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Individualization is what humans do.</strong> It's recognition, relationship memory, and genuine knowing. It's when your banker remembers you hate long hold times, or knows your business has seasonal cash flow, or understands you're risk-averse because of what happened in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Community banks keep chasing \"personalization\" because that's the fintech language. But your actual advantage is <em>individualization</em>, and you're often not delivering it because you're distracted by an arms race you can't win.</p>\n\n<p>When we work with clients on positioning, we use a simple framework. First, clarify your category by asking what box you compete in and what customers are comparing you to. Second, define your edge by identifying the mechanism that makes you different and what you can prove.</p>\n\n<p>Most FIs can articulate the box. \"We're a community bank for small businesses.\" \"We're a credit union for educators.\" The category is clear.</p>\n\n<p>The edge is where they struggle, because the edge has to be true, not aspirational. It has to be something you actually do differently, not something you hope to do. And here's the hard part: in a world where features are commoditized and digital is table stakes, <strong>the edge almost always comes back to brand.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your edge isn't your mobile app. It's what customers <em>feel</em> when they use it. Your edge isn't your loan rates. It's why they <em>trust</em> you with their money. Your edge isn't your branch network. It's what happens inside those branches that can't be replicated by a competitor with the same vendor stack.</p>\n\n<p>Brand is the only moat left because it's the only thing that can't be copied. Features can be copied, technology can be copied, and even service models can be copied. But the meaning you create, the trust you've earned, and the reason someone chooses you when everything else is equal? That's brand, and that's defensible.</p>\n\n<p>But moving brand to the center isn't a project. It's a discipline. The saltshaker will move every single day, good numbers will tell you everything's fine, entropy will do its work, and busy will masquerade as bold.</p>\n\n<p>Your job is to keep moving it back!</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

Teams that own their domain can move fast and build expertise. The trouble starts when those silos stop talking to each other, and that's when the customer gets a fragmented experience and you lose momentum.</p>\n\n<p>When marketing, product, and CX aren't aligned, customers notice. They get mixed messages, disconnected journeys, and inconsistent value. The customer doesn't care about your org chart. They care about whether their experience makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>I've watched this play out dozens of times. A client will come to me convinced they have a \"brand awareness problem\" or a \"customer acquisition problem.\" Sometimes they do. More often, they have an alignment problem wearing a brand problem's clothes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One client, a regional bank with six high-performing teams, was convinced their growth issue was brand awareness. It wasn't.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every team was running hard toward a different metric. Cards optimized for spend while deposits chased acquisition and CX measured satisfaction. They were all moving fast, but none of them were in sync.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what that looks like from the customer's side. The cards team sends an offer for a premium card, the deposits team sends a separate campaign about savings rates, and CX follows up asking about satisfaction from a branch visit. That's three touchpoints, three different relationships, and zero coherence.</p>\n\n<p>The fix wasn't a rebrand or a new campaign. We built a shared \"Growth Dashboard\" that tracked one thing: customer momentum across touchpoints. Not individual metrics in isolation, but how customers were actually progressing through their relationship with the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Each silo kept doing its job. Cards still optimized for spend, deposits still chased growth, and CX still measured satisfaction. But now they worked in the same direction because they could see how their work connected to the customer's actual journey, not just their slice of it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results: deposits up 12%, fewer campaign conflicts, and faster decisions.</strong> The teams were just as fast individually, but collectively they stopped tripping over each other.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is what didn't change. Nobody lost their silo and nobody gave up ownership. The walls came down, but the specialization remained. That's the difference between alignment and homogeneity. Alignment means working toward the same outcome, while homogeneity means everyone doing the same thing. One builds momentum and the other kills expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Most \"brand problems\" are alignment problems. When customers describe your brand as \"confusing\" or \"inconsistent,\" they're usually not critiquing your logo or your tagline. They're describing their experience of your organization's misalignment. They just don't have the language to say it that way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's a quick test.</strong> Ask three team leaders: \"What are we solving for this quarter?\" If you get three different answers, you don't have a strategy problem. You have an alignment problem. The strategy might be clear at the top, but it's just not connected to what teams are actually doing.</p>\n\n<p>There's a simple exercise that surfaces this. I call it a \"Silo Sync,\" and it takes about 30 minutes. Each team brings one slide answering three questions:</p>\n\n<p>That's it. You don't need an elaborate offsite or a consultant-led workshop. Just 30 minutes of forced visibility. You'll be surprised how often teams don't know what each other is working on, and even more surprised at how many obvious handoff problems surface in a single meeting.</p>\n\n<p>The dependencies question is the most revealing. Teams often don't realize they're waiting on each other, or they've built workarounds that create friction downstream. Once those dependencies are visible, solutions usually follow quickly. People are smart. They just need the information.</p>\n\n<p>The third question is the hardest. \"One way we could create a smoother customer journey together\" forces teams to think beyond their metrics. It asks them to consider what the customer actually experiences, not just what they measure. That shift in perspective is where alignment starts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good silos build capability. Great brands build connection.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The capability comes from focus and deep expertise in cards, in deposits, in CX. That specialization is valuable. But the connection comes from alignment, from teams that understand how their work fits together and from an organization that designs for the customer's experience, not just internal ownership.</p>\n\n<p>You don't have to choose between the two.

They're suffering from outdated frames.</p>\n\n<p>A rebrand changes how you look, while a reframe changes how you are understood. The difference is subtle but critical: rebrands tend to focus on what the company wants to say, but reframes focus on what the market actually needs to hear.</p>\n\n<p>In 2026, the brands creating real growth are not the ones shouting the loudest or refreshing their logos. They're the ones translating their conviction into clarity, reframing their role in a market that has changed faster than their messaging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is not a cosmetic problem - it's a comprehension problem.</strong></p>\n\n<p>During a recent conversation with a Wisconsin community bank, their CMO said something that stopped me: \"We thought we had an aging market. Turns out, we just have an aging customer base.\"</p>\n\n<p>That single realization reshaped their growth strategy. Their brand was strong and their story was heartfelt, but their frame was anchored in who they used to serve. Their customers were changing faster than their communications, and the logo didn't need work - the lens did.</p>\n\n<p>A fintech founder I spoke with the same week had a similar moment. His company had doubled revenue two years in a row, added major enterprise clients, and built a genuinely credible product. Yet when I asked him \"Why do you matter in this market right now?\" the answer took three minutes and a PowerPoint deck to get through.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a clarity problem - it's a framing problem.</p>\n\n<p>Both teams had momentum but lacked precision. Their brands were working hard but not smart, and they didn't need a full redesign. They needed to reframe their value in a way that the market could instantly understand and repeat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's what I've noticed about framing problems: they hide behind success.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When revenue is growing and customers are renewing, it's easy to assume the story is working. But growth can mask drift, and you keep winning the customers who already get you while becoming invisible to the ones who should.</p>\n\n<p>The Wisconsin bank had strong relationships with longtime customers, but they weren't showing up in the consideration set for younger business owners who had moved to town in the last five years. The fintech had a product that customers loved, but prospects couldn't articulate what made it different from the three other platforms they were evaluating.</p>\n\n<p>In both cases, the work wasn't broken - the frame was just too narrow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reframing isn't about abandoning your story. It's about updating the container.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think of it this way: a rebrand is like renovating your house with new paint, new fixtures, and maybe knocking out a wall. A reframe is like realizing you've been showing people the wrong rooms. The house is fine, but the tour needs to change.</p>\n\n<p>The fintech founder didn't need a new logo or a new website. He needed a new answer to \"what do you do?\" that could travel - something a customer could repeat to their CFO in an elevator, or something a prospect could remember after evaluating five vendors in a week.</p>\n\n<p>The community bank didn't need new colors or a new tagline. They needed to tell a story that resonated with business owners who had never set foot in a branch and didn't plan to - same values, different frame.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most messaging audits ask the wrong question.</strong></p>\n\n<p>They ask \"Is this clear?\" when the better question is \"Is this understood by the people we need to reach next?\"</p>\n\n<p>Clarity is necessary but not sufficient. You can be perfectly clear about something that doesn't matter to your future customers, and you can articulate your value proposition with precision while still speaking a language your market has moved on from.</p>\n\n<p>The real test is whether someone who has never heard of you can hear your story once and know exactly who you're for and why you're different - not because you told them, but because the frame made it obvious.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Try this with your team.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ask two questions and resist the urge to rush through them.</p>\n\n<p>First: What are we assuming still works? List the programs, channels, or messages that have been \"good enough\" for years, and identify which of those are now habits rather than strategies - the things you keep doing because you've always done them, not because they're producing results for the customers you want to reach next.</p>\n\n<p>Second: Who in our market is aging out of our story? Pull your demographic data and ask whether your story, visuals, and tone still speak to the customers you want or just the ones you already have. The Wisconsin bank discovered their messaging was optimized for customers who valued relationships built over decades, and it said almost nothing to founders who valued speed, digital access, and a bank that understood their business model.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The honest answers to these questions usually reveal where the frame has drifted.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not dramatically, and not in a way that shows up in quarterly numbers yet, but in a way that explains why certain opportunities aren't converting, why certain markets feel harder than they should, and why growth feels like it's coming from the same pool of people over and over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legacy is not built by repeating what worked before.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's built by reframing what still matters now. Your market evolves and your customers evolve, and the best brands evolve their story to match - not by abandoning what made them distinctive, but by translating it for the people they need to reach next.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether your brand needs a refresh. It's whether your frame still fits the market you're trying to win.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

Premium stuff, the kind of gift that would sit on a desk for years.</p>\n\n<p>They got a quote from a big distributor who promised fast turnaround and competitive pricing. But when the samples arrived, something was off. The leather felt thin and the stitching was uneven. It looked fine in photos, but in hand it felt cheap.</p>\n\n<p>So they pivoted and found a small maker two states over, a workshop that had been handcrafting leather goods for thirty years. The timeline stretched by three weeks and the cost per unit went up slightly, but the quality was night and day.</p>\n\n<p>When the gifts arrived, recipients posted photos. One client emailed to ask who made them because they wanted to order more for their own team. Another displayed it in a Zoom background for months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's what happens when you work with someone who treats their craft like it matters.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The maker you choose sends a message even if their name never appears on the product. If you're sourcing from someone who's optimizing for speed and margin, that's what you'll get. But if you're working with someone who understands materials, storytelling, and quality, that shows up too.</p>\n\n<p>You can feel the difference. Your recipients can feel it. And whether they articulate it or not, that feeling shapes how they think about you.</p>\n\n<p>A fintech startup I worked with wanted to celebrate a product milestone with something their employees would actually use. They could have ordered generic posters from any print-on-demand service, but instead they found a local printer who specialized in limited-run art prints.</p>\n\n<p>The designer took time to understand the company's aesthetic. She asked questions about the team's vibe and wanted to know what the milestone meant to them and why it mattered.</p>\n\n<p>The result wasn't just a poster. It was a piece of art that felt like it belonged to them.</p>\n\n<p>Employees framed it. Prospects asked about it during office tours. It became part of how they told their story, not because it was expensive but because it was <em>intentional</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There's a pattern here. The companies that get this right aren't necessarily spending more money. They're spending it differently. They're choosing partners who ask questions instead of just taking orders, partners who care about the outcome and not just the transaction.</p>\n\n<p>If your brand values craftsmanship, don't outsource to the lowest bidder. If your culture celebrates creativity, work with makers who think like artists. If your story is about community, source locally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The partner you choose either amplifies your values or contradicts them.</strong> There's no neutral ground.</p>\n\n<p>This matters more than most companies realize. Every touchpoint tells a story through the weight of the paper, the quality of the stitching, and the care that went into the packaging. These details register, even when people can't name what they're noticing.</p>\n\n<p>When you work with a maker who takes pride in their work, that pride transfers. When you work with a vendor who's cutting corners to hit a price point, that transfers too.</p>\n\n<p>Great swag doesn't start with a purchase order. It starts with a conversation with someone who asks questions and wants to understand what you're trying to say and why it matters.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a vendor relationship. That's a partnership. And partnerships are how you build something that actually represents who you are.</p>\n\n<p>Think about the last piece of swag your company sent, and then think about who made it.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know their name? Their story? Why they do what they do?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, that's not a judgment. It's an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Most companies treat sourcing as a procurement function where you get the best price, hit the deadline, and move on. But what if you treated it as a brand function? What if the makers you work with became part of your story?</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most memorable brand moments I've seen came from unexpected partnerships. A bank that worked with a local coffee roaster for client gifts. A fintech that commissioned a ceramicist to create limited-edition mugs for their top performers. A credit union that partnered with a regional letterpress shop for their annual report.</p>\n\n<p>None of these were obvious choices, but all of them created something worth talking about.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether you can afford to work with better makers. It's whether you can afford not to. Every piece of swag that feels generic is a missed opportunity to reinforce what you stand for, and every partnership with a maker who cares is a chance to show that you care too.</p>\n\n<p>What if your next send came from a maker you'd be proud to introduce to your clients? Someone whose story you'd want to tell? Someone who'd make your recipients stop and notice?</p>\n\n<p>That's the bar. Not \"good enough to send,\" but good enough to be proud of.</p>\n\n<p>Find makers who meet it.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

Bill Walton, two-time NCAA Player of the Year under Wooden, confirmed it directly: when they were dressing for a game, managers had to fetch a program so the team could find out who their opponents were. Wooden never mentioned the opposition.</p>\n\n<p>There were no scouting reports, no hype about facing ranked opponents, and no game-specific preparation talks. Players showed up, executed what they'd trained to do, and let the results follow.</p>\n\n<p>The results: ten national championships in twelve years, eighty-eight consecutive wins, seven straight titles, and four perfect seasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's the nuance that matters: Wooden's program did scout opponents. The information just never reached players.</strong></p>\n\n<p>His assistant coach Jerry Norman was instrumental in competitive preparation. Norman devised the diamond-and-one defense that held Elvin Hayes to 10 points in the 1968 tournament semifinal when Hayes was averaging 37.7 points per game that season. If the team was likely to face a zone defense, Wooden might add extra zone offense work to practice, but he never mentioned why. Players didn't know the purpose of the adjustment.</p>\n\n<p>The accurate statement isn't that Wooden ignored competitors. It's that he kept opponent information away from the people doing the work. Leadership held the competitive context while the team focused on execution.</p>\n\n<p>This distinction matters for application. The lesson isn't \"don't do competitive intelligence.\" It's about where that intelligence lives and who it reaches.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wooden understood something fundamental about where attention goes.</strong> When players know they're facing the top-ranked team in the country, they play differently. They tighten up and second-guess. They start hoping the game plan works instead of trusting their training. By removing opponent information, he removed a source of performance anxiety entirely.</p>\n\n<p>His core philosophy was simple: the more concerned we become over the things we can't control, the less we will do with the things we can control. Players could not control what opponents did. They could only control their own execution. So that's all they were asked to think about.</p>\n\n<p>This created a consistent level of respect for all opponents through the consistent excellent effort he demanded in practice every week, whether the next opponent was the last place team in the league or the number two team in the country. There were no letdown games against weaker opponents and no intimidation against stronger ones, just the same preparation, same intensity, and same standard every week.</p>\n\n<p>The psychological benefit was clarity. Players were not worried about the competition. They were on the hook for one thing: their execution and effort. You weren't evaluated on whether you outperformed your matchup. You were evaluated on whether you executed what you trained to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wooden famously never mentioned winning to his teams.</strong> His definition of success was peace of mind from knowing you did the best of which you are capable. He wanted winning to be the byproduct of the preparation, not the focus of it. When you prepare correctly and execute fully, results follow. Focusing on results directly undermines the process that produces them.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn't anti-intellectual stubbornness. It was a coherent system optimizing for psychological readiness, process discipline, and sustainable excellence across changing rosters and competitive environments.</p>\n\n<p>By all accounts, Wooden's practices were extraordinarily demanding. Walton described them as the most demanding endeavors he'd ever been part of, physically, emotionally, mentally, and psychologically taxing. But within that intensity, there was always a sense of joy, of celebration, of people having fun playing a simple game.</p>\n\n<p>The tradeoff was clear: less time on opponent-specific preparation meant more time on fundamentals, conditioning, and team execution. Wooden bet that elite fundamentals would beat opponent-specific adjustments. He was right ten times over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There's a prerequisite to this approach that's worth stating directly.</strong> You can only ignore opponents when your execution is better than their adjustments. Wooden could filter out competitive noise because UCLA's fundamentals were elite. The strategy works when you've done the work to be genuinely better at what matters.</p>\n\n<p>You earn the right to stop obsessing over competitors by being excellent at your craft. The causality runs in that direction.</p>\n\n<p>This brings us to application. What would it look like to apply Wooden's model to how a bank or fintech operates?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The first implication is about where competitive intelligence should live.</strong> The Wooden model suggests it belongs at the leadership level, informing strategy, not saturating the people doing the work. Your product teams, relationship managers, and customer-facing staff should be focused on execution and customer outcomes. They don't need to know what competitors announced at a conference last week. That information is more likely to create anxiety and reactive thinking than improved performance.</p>\n\n<p>Leadership can hold competitive context while the organization executes against its own standard.</p>\n\n<p>Think about the last time a competitor announcement rippled through your organization. Did it improve anyone's work, or did it just create noise? Did it sharpen focus, or did it scatter attention across what-ifs and should-wes? For most organizations, the honest answer is that competitive information distracts more than it directs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The second implication is about consistency.</strong> When you're focused on being different, your energy fluctuates based on what competitors are doing. A new entrant, a funding announcement, a feature launch: each creates reactive pressure. Your intensity varies based on external signals.</p>\n\n<p>When you're focused on being better, your standard is internal. You're competing against your own potential, not last quarter's competitor moves. That consistency compounds over time. It's the same excellent effort every week, regardless of who you're facing or what they just announced.</p>\n\n<p>This is harder than it sounds. It requires discipline to maintain the same standard when a competitor raises a huge round as when the market is quiet. It requires leadership that doesn't escalate competitive noise into organizational anxiety. It requires trust that doing your work well will produce better outcomes than reacting to their work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The third implication is about what your teams are accountable for.</strong> Wooden's players weren't trying to be better than their opponents. They were trying to be the best version of themselves. The parallel for financial services organizations: are your people accountable for outcomes relative to competitors, or for their own execution?</p>\n\n<p>When accountability is framed as \"beat X's market share\" or \"close the gap with Y,\" you're pointing attention outward. When accountability is framed as \"hit our targets,\" \"deliver on our commitments,\" or \"improve our metrics,\" you're pointing attention inward. The second frame produces more sustainable performance because it's based on controllables.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't mean you ignore market position entirely. It means you separate strategic awareness, which leadership holds, from operational focus, which is what teams execute against.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question worth asking is what would happen if your teams spent zero time thinking about competitors and all their time thinking about how to be better at what matters to your customers.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For most organizations, that shift would improve performance, not hurt it. The hours spent analyzing competitor positioning, tracking their announcements, and debating their strategies could go toward understanding customer outcomes, refining your own execution, and building capabilities that genuinely matter.</p>\n\n<p>Wooden's players didn't need to know who they were facing to know what excellent performance looked like. Your teams probably don't either.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some diagnostic questions to assess where your organization falls on this spectrum. In your last three strategy meetings, what percentage of time was spent discussing competitors versus discussing customer outcomes? Does competitive intelligence reach everyone in your organization, or is it filtered at the leadership level? When teams fall short, is the conversation about what competitors did or about your own execution gaps? Does your organization's intensity vary based on competitive pressure, or does it maintain a constant standard regardless of market noise?</p>\n\n<p>The answers reveal where attention is going. And where attention goes, energy follows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wooden once said that he never mentioned the opposition because he wanted the emphasis placed on the improvement of ourselves.</strong> That's a simple sentence, but it contains an entire operating philosophy. He was making a deliberate choice about where to point his team's attention, and he was betting that internal focus would outperform external comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Ten championships suggest the bet paid off.</p>\n\n<p>The question for banks and fintechs isn't whether to gather competitive intelligence. Of course you should understand your market. The question is who that intelligence reaches and what they're expected to do with it. The answer probably isn't \"everyone\" and \"react.\"</p>\n\n<p>Leadership holds context, teams focus on execution, and excellence comes from within rather than from comparison. In a market where everyone is watching everyone else, the organization that's genuinely focused on being better might be the most differentiated of all.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

The question is: how do we differentiate? It sounds like the right question because it's been the cornerstone of strategic planning for decades. But I've started to wonder if it's actually pointing us in the wrong direction.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I mean. Customers aren't waking up and wondering how one bank differs from another, or which embedded finance provider has a slightly different API configuration. They're not comparison shopping on the dimensions we typically compete on. They're trying to solve a problem or reach a goal, and they want someone who can help them get there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The more useful question is: how are we better?</strong> And then you keep going. Better for whom? Better for what? Better at helping them get where?</p>\n\n<p>This might sound like semantics, but there's a real strategic difference. When you ask how you're different, the conversation tends to drift toward products and features and functionality. You end up comparing rate sheets, app screenshots, integration capabilities, and partner ecosystems. You watch what competitors are doing at conferences and feel pressure to match their moves. But when you ask how you're better, you have to get specific about outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what that specificity looks like in practice. You might be better for small business owners who are scaling past their first million in revenue and need a banking partner who moves at their speed. Or better for credit unions looking for a technology partner who actually understands their member-first model. Or better for families building generational wealth who want guidance that goes beyond basic portfolio allocation. <strong>That clarity about who you're better for and what you're helping them achieve changes everything about how you show up in the market.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was talking with a banker recently who was writing about experience enablement for her organization. Her bank, like many financial institutions, has a customer promise built around delivering a \"highly differentiated client experience.\" She made an observation that stuck with me: saying you want to be differentiating is only the beginning of a thought, not the destination. What you really mean is that you want to be better at something specific, whether that's being faster, more responsive, more human, or more aligned with how your customers actually operate. The word \"differentiating\" lets you off the hook from defining what better actually means.</p>\n\n<p>There's something else worth noticing about the differentiation mindset. It tends to keep your attention fixed on peers rather than pointed toward excellence. When you're focused on being different, you end up tracking what other banks are announcing, what fintechs are raising money, what technology your competitors just bought. You can spend so much energy on competitive intelligence that you lose sight of your own path forward.</p>\n\n<p>John Wooden, the most successful coach in college basketball history, understood this deeply. His UCLA players famously didn't know who their opponents were until game day. Bill Walton recalls that managers had to fetch a program so the team could find out who they were playing.</p>\n\n<p>But here's the nuance that matters: Wooden's staff did scout opponents. His assistant coach Jerry Norman devised specific defensive schemes that held future NBA stars to a fraction of their scoring averages. The competitive intelligence existed, but it never reached the players.</p>\n\n<p>Wooden understood something about where attention goes. When players know they're facing the top-ranked team in the country, they play differently. They tighten up and second-guess. They start hoping the game plan works instead of executing what they've trained to do. So he made a deliberate choice: players would be accountable for one thing only, their own execution and effort. The results speak for themselves: ten national championships in twelve years, eighty-eight consecutive wins, and seven straight titles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The lesson for financial services isn't \"ignore your competitors.\"</strong> It's about where you point your organization's attention. Competitive intelligence has a place, but that place is probably at the leadership level, informing strategy, not saturating the people doing the work. When your teams are focused on being better at what matters to customers, the differentiation takes care of itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The most effective organizations I work with spend less time looking at peers and more time looking at what high-performing brands in other industries are doing.</strong> What are the companies that truly delight customers doing that we could learn from? That question tells you more about where customer expectations are heading than another industry conference ever will. The market is bigger than we often admit, and the best inspiration usually comes from outside our own category.</p>\n\n<p>This brings up a related point about how features and technology fit into all of this. They absolutely matter, but they come later in the order of operations. First, you understand what \"better\" means for your target customer in their specific context. Then you figure out what capabilities enable that better experience, whether those are internal builds, partner integrations, or platform acquisitions. The technology becomes a means to an end rather than the end itself. When you start with capabilities instead of outcomes, you end up with solutions looking for problems rather than the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>Great brands have always been built this way, and that's still possible in financial services even though the path has changed. Banks used to be able to rely on being the pillar of a community, the institution everyone knew and trusted by default. Fintechs used to be able to rely on the novelty of being digital-first. Neither of those is automatic anymore. But you can still build a brand that lasts, that grows, that people genuinely choose and recommend. <strong>It just requires being intentional about what you're better at and for whom.</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's a misconception that comes up whenever brand strategy is on the table, and it usually takes the form of a question: how do you measure brand? I've come to believe that the question itself reveals something about how we think about brand as separate from business, when they're actually the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>You measure brand the same way you measure business success. When you're growing, hitting your goals, and seeing customers stay and refer, you have a strong brand. When those things aren't happening, your brand needs work. <strong>Brand is the company.</strong> When we treat them as distinct, we're making a category error that leads to underinvestment and misaligned priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Brand equity shows up in real enterprise value, which matters especially in an M&A environment. When a bank acquires another institution or a fintech gets acquired by a strategic buyer, they're not just picking up customers and capabilities. They're picking up brand strength, or potentially diluting their own. Having a strong brand is part of what makes any organization worth more, whether you're trying to grow independently or position yourself as an attractive acquisition target.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is that you're going to have a brand whether you invest in it or not, because culture, communication, and reputation exist regardless of whether you're paying attention to them. The only question is whether you're going to shape them intentionally or let them emerge on their own. A brand left unattended doesn't disappear; it just becomes something you didn't choose.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a common conflation between marketing and brand that's worth untangling. A lot of executives hear \"brand\" and think colors, logos, maybe a tagline. They picture a rebrand project with new fonts and a revised color palette. But that's the visual identity, which is just one expression of brand. <strong>Brand is actually an ethos, a spirit, a persona.</strong> It's how every person in your organization shows up, how decisions get made, and what you prioritize when priorities conflict. The visual identity reflects that deeper reality, but it doesn't create it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marketing is a practitioner skill, but brand is everyone's job.</strong> You don't need to know how to run a paid media campaign or optimize an email sequence to contribute to brand strength. But you do need to understand that every interaction, every decision, and every customer touchpoint either reinforces or undermines what you're trying to build. The way a relationship manager handles a difficult conversation is brand. The speed at which a support team responds to a complaint is brand. The priorities a product team sets when resources are constrained is brand.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this look like in practice? Try auditing your own language and noticing how often you and your team use the word \"differentiation.\" See what shifts when you replace it with \"better\" and then keep going: better for whom, and better for what? The conversation tends to move in a more productive direction when you frame it that way.</p>\n\n<p>Consider where you're spending energy on competitive comparison versus understanding customer outcomes. The hours spent analyzing competitor positioning might be better spent talking to customers about what they're actually trying to accomplish and where they're getting stuck. Look at which brands outside of financial services you admire, and ask what it would look like to bring some of that thinking into your organization.</p>\n\n<p>When someone asks how you measure brand, try answering with the same metrics you use to measure business success. Growth, retention, referrals, market position. If those are moving in the right direction, your brand is working, because <strong>brand and business aren't separate things that need separate measurement frameworks.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The shift from \"different\" to \"better\" isn't just about word choice. It's about where you point your attention and what kind of strategy emerges from that focus. Different is about competitors. Better is about customers. And in a market where everyone is chasing differentiation, being genuinely better for a specific group might be the most distinctive thing you can do.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

Conference attendees, prospects, and customers walk away with bags that disappear into closets, stress balls that end up in junk drawers, and charging cables that get tossed into a bin of identical charging cables from every other booth.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, your employees keep asking when they'll get new company gear. The last hoodie drop was two years ago, and people are still wearing them even though they're faded and pilling.</p>\n\n<p>A fintech client came to me frustrated last year because they'd spent tens of thousands on tradeshow swag. All the usual stuff, and it disappeared fast with no posts, no buzz, just gone.</p>\n\n<p>But their employees kept requesting new gear. The last internal swag order was ancient, yet people wore it anyway with its faded logos and pilling fabric.</p>\n\n<p>So we flipped the budget.</p>\n\n<p>We cut the conference spend in half and reinvested in an employee swag refresh. But we didn't just order hoodies. We asked the team what they actually wanted, what they'd wear on weekends, and what would make them feel proud rather than obligated.</p>\n\n<p>The result was a capsule collection with quality basics and subtle branding, designed with input from employees across departments.</p>\n\n<p>On launch day, people posted. Not because they were told to, but because they wanted to. The swag showed up in Zoom backgrounds, LinkedIn photos, and team outings. Recruiter interest ticked up, and candidates mentioned seeing the gear online and wanting to be part of \"whatever culture creates that kind of energy.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's internal momentum spilling externally.</strong> You can't manufacture that with a tradeshow booth.</p>\n\n<p>A community bank I worked with took a different approach and built a recognition program around swag. Employees could nominate peers for going above and beyond, and winners got a custom item, a handwritten note from leadership, and a shoutout in the company Slack.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't expensive: a jacket, a backpack, or a limited-edition print.</p>\n\n<p>But people displayed them like trophies. New hires asked how to earn one. The swag became a signal that said <em>this is what it looks like to live our values</em>. It stopped being merchandise and started being meaning.</p>\n\n<p>The external marketing budget stayed flat, but the internal investment created something money can't buy directly: genuine enthusiasm from people who actually know what working there feels like.</p>\n\n<p>Before you market anything externally, your team has to believe in it. Internal alignment creates external confidence. When employees genuinely want to represent your brand, they carry it into every meeting, every message, and every moment. They don't need a social media policy to post about work because they do it because they're proud.</p>\n\n<p>Swag supports that, not by forcing it but by giving people something they're actually proud to wear or use. Something that reflects the culture they're building together.</p>\n\n<p>The swag that works best is designed for the person wearing it rather than for the people who might see it. It's high quality because the assumption is that it's worth keeping, and it's specific because someone asked what people actually want.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you flip those assumptions, swag becomes something else entirely: a tangible expression of belonging.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your swag strategy only faces outward, you're missing the group with the most influence. Not prospects or customers or conference attendees who will forget your brand name by the time they get to baggage claim.</p>\n\n<p>The people who show up every day and decide whether your brand story is real or just marketing. The people who answer when customers call. The people who build the product. The people who recruit the next wave of talent.</p>\n\n<p>Your employees are your most credible marketers. And unlike paid media, their endorsement can't be bought. It has to be earned.</p>\n\n<p>Look at the last piece of swag your company gave employees. Did they wear it? Use it? Post about it? Or is it sitting in a drawer somewhere?</p>\n\n<p>If you're not sure, that's worth knowing before your next order.</p>\n\n<p>Before your next order, ask yourself three things. Would someone wear this on a weekend? If not, you're creating obligation rather than enthusiasm. The best swag doesn't feel like corporate merch; it feels like something you'd buy yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Did you ask before you ordered? The companies getting this right involve employees in the design process with actual input on styles, materials, and what would make them proud to wear it, not just \"pick a color.\"</p>\n\n<p>And what story does this tell? Every piece of swag sends a message. Cheap stress balls say \"we needed something for the booth,\" while limited-edition jackets earned through peer recognition say \"we notice when people live our values.\" Which message are you sending?</p>\n\n<p>The best swag budgets aren't marketing expenses. They're culture investments. Spending $50 on a quality item for someone who shows up every day beats spending $5 on trinkets for strangers who might become customers someday.</p>\n\n<p>Your employees are already your brand ambassadors, whether you're a regional bank, a growing fintech, or a credit union serving a tight-knit community. The question is whether you're equipping them to be good ones with the hoodie they actually want to wear, the jacket they earned through peer recognition, and the gear that makes them feel like they belong to something worth belonging to.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a swag strategy. That's a brand strategy that happens to include swag.</p>\n\n<p>And it starts by asking a simple question: what would make our people proud to represent us? The answer is usually more accessible than you'd expect, if you're willing to listen.</p>\n\n<p>Talk soon,</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n<hr style=\"border: none; border-top: 3px solid #FFEB3B; margin: 32px 0;\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;\"><img src=\"https://brandthnk.co/assets/book-cover.png\" alt=\"Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank - Second Edition\" style=\"max-width: 320px; height: auto;\"></p>\n\n<p>Think Like a Brand, Not a Bank is now available 🎉<br><br>BrandThnk Briefing subscribers (that’s you!) get 15% off for a limited time.<br><br>Head over <a href=\"https://brandthnk.co/#book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><span>here</span></a> and use coupon code BVOLVIF.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.

This erosion happens so gradually that most organizations don't notice it until the symptoms become impossible to ignore. The campaigns still run. The metrics still get reported. The team still stays busy. But somewhere along the way, the story stopped moving the market, and nobody can pinpoint exactly when it happened.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most financial brands do not lose relevance because their competitors out-innovate them.</strong> They lose because what <em>once worked</em> becomes what <em>always works</em> in their minds. The playbooks get laminated, treated as sacred texts rather than working documents. The data gets interpreted through yesterday's lens, filtered through assumptions that nobody thinks to question because questioning them would require admitting that the ground has shifted beneath your feet.</p>\n\n<p>The result is subtle stagnation dressed up as stability. You can feel busy and productive while slowly drifting away from the market you're supposed to serve. You can hit your quarterly numbers while missing the fundamental changes that will make those numbers irrelevant in three years. This is the assumption trap, and it catches smart, experienced teams precisely because they have earned the right to trust their instincts. The problem is that instincts formed in one market environment can become liabilities when that environment changes.</p>\n\n<p>I saw this play out vividly at a recent strategy session with a progressive community bank. The CMO said something that stopped me cold: <strong>\"We realized we have an aging customer base, not an aging market.\"</strong> This distinction sounds simple, but it represented a fundamental reframe of everything they thought they knew about their business.</p>\n\n<p>For years, this bank had built their strategy around the belief that their small towns were shrinking and aging. The demographic data seemed to support this narrative, or at least it did when viewed through a particular lens. Their marketing reflected this assumption, targeting the customers they already had rather than the customers they could have. Their product development prioritized the needs of longtime account holders rather than anticipating what newcomers might want. Their branch strategy assumed that foot traffic would continue declining because that's what the trend lines suggested.</p>\n\n<p>When we actually looked at the data with fresh eyes, we found a different story entirely. The towns weren't shrinking; they were growing. The demographics weren't aging; they were getting younger and more diverse. The problem wasn't the market. The problem was that the bank's customer base had calcified while the community around them transformed. They had been marketing to who they knew rather than who had moved in. Their customers were aging, but their market was full of young families, remote workers who'd relocated during the pandemic, and small business owners who'd never considered a community bank because no community bank had ever spoken to them.</p>\n\n<p>Their marketing had been shaped by a <strong>perfectly logical, perfectly wrong assumption</strong>. And because the assumption felt true, because it matched what they saw when they looked at their existing customers, nobody had thought to verify it against what was actually happening in the broader community. This is how assumption traps work. They feel like wisdom because they're built on real experience. But experience with yesterday's market can blind you to today's reality.</p>\n\n<p>When we looked deeper, we found a dozen more examples of assumptions operating as invisible constraints. They had chosen certain distribution channels because those channels had worked fifteen years ago, not because they still made sense. Their messaging was calibrated to a mindset that their target customers had moved past. Their creative decisions were made to comfort internal stakeholders rather than capture external attention. They were running a 2010 playbook in a 2025 market and wondering why the results felt flat.</p>\n\n<p>Once those assumptions surfaced, everything changed. The team shifted from defending the old narrative to testing a new one. The reframe wasn't radical in execution. It was grounded in fresh data and internal honesty. But acknowledging what they no longer knew opened up possibilities that had been invisible when certainty ruled. They updated their visual identity to speak to a younger audience. They shifted their audience mix to reflect who actually lived in their footprint. They rewrote their messaging to address the concerns of first-time homebuyers and young entrepreneurs rather than assuming their only opportunity was to retain retirees.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sometimes the biggest act of brand courage is admitting what you no longer know.</strong> It feels risky because expertise is supposed to provide certainty, and certainty is supposed to provide confidence, and confidence is supposed to drive results. But false certainty is worse than honest uncertainty. When you assume you understand your market, you stop looking at your market. When you stop looking, you stop learning. When you stop learning, you start drifting. And by the time you realize you've drifted, the effort required to course-correct has multiplied dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>I want to offer you a practical tool for surfacing your own assumptions before they become traps. I call it an <strong>Assumption Audit</strong>, and it works best when you run it with your leadership or marketing team in a dedicated session rather than trying to squeeze it into a crowded agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Start by listing every belief you hold about your audience, your brand, and your market. Don't filter for importance; just get them all on paper or on a whiteboard. You're looking for the things you treat as facts rather than hypotheses. Statements like \"our customers are primarily over 55\" or \"people in our market prefer in-person service\" or \"price is the main decision driver for our segment.\" These beliefs shape every decision you make, so you need to see them clearly before you can evaluate them honestly.</p>\n\n<p>Next to each belief, add one of three labels. The first label is <em>\"proven recently,\"</em> which means you have data supporting this belief from the last twelve months. Not data from five years ago that you assume still applies, but current evidence that this is actually true in today's market. The second label is <em>\"assumed true,\"</em> which means you think it's right but you have no current proof. This is the dangerous category, the beliefs that feel so obvious that nobody has bothered to verify them. The third label is <em>\"inherited truth,\"</em> which means you say it because it has always been said. These are the beliefs that predate the current team, the things everyone \"knows\" without anyone remembering where the knowledge came from.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've labeled everything, focus your next quarter's learning budget on converting assumed and inherited truths into proven ones. This might mean commissioning fresh research, running small experiments, or simply asking your frontline team what they're actually hearing from customers. The goal isn't to find fault or to blame anyone for holding incorrect beliefs. The goal is to <strong>replace comfort with clarity</strong>, to build strategy on evidence rather than echo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your biggest competitor isn't another fintech or bank. It's the belief that you already understand your market.</strong> That belief feels like an asset because it provides confidence and direction. But when it's wrong, when the market has shifted while your assumptions stayed fixed, it becomes the heaviest anchor you're dragging. Curiosity is uncomfortable because it requires admitting uncertainty, but <strong>brands that get curious again get interesting again</strong>. They start seeing opportunities that certainty made invisible. They start speaking to audiences that assumptions had written off. They start building strategies that match reality rather than memory.</p>\n\n<p>If your team's strategy feels familiar in all the wrong ways, if you're executing the same playbook with diminishing returns and can't figure out why, it might be time for an Assumption Audit. The truths you inherit are not always the truths you should keep. The market you remember is not always the market you serve. And the customers you know are not always the customers you could have.</p>\n\n<p>I'm happy to share the framework we use with our clients if you want to run this exercise with your team. Just let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Allison</p>\n\n<p>If your team’s strategy feels familiar in all the wrong ways, it might be time for an Assumption Audit.</p>\n\n<p>Happy to share the framework that we use with our clients….just let me know!</p>\n\n<p>—Allison</p>\n\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"footer\">\r\n    <p>\r\n      The BrandThnk Briefing goes to FI and fintech leaders working on brand,\r\n      positioning, and operating models.
